In fact, you will build two deep neural networks and ensemble them.\n","\n","The data was collected with a MYO armband electromyography (EMG) sensor (see image below). The data was made available by Kirill Yashuk and can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kyr7plus/emg-4).

During training time, you train the two networks with the same train data but each network should have a different architecture. There is no point of building the same two networks because they will produce the same predictions. At test time, a given instance is fed into both networks. Each network outputs the predicted probabilities for each class (by specifying the last activation to be softmax). One way to combine the predictions of both networks is to multiply the output probabilities and predict the class with the highest one. When more than two models compose the ensemble, majority voting can also be used.\n","\n","1. First, you need to randomly split the dataset into several subsets to avoid overfitting. Specifically, you will need **4 subsets**:\n","\n","<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://github.com/enriquegit/ap-img/blob/main/img/splits.png?raw=true\" width=\"250\"></td></tr></table>\n","\n","  - **train set (60%):** This one is used to train the two models.\n","  - **val1 set (10%):** This is used to fine tune parameters of your nueral networks.\n","  - **val2 set (15%):** This one is used to validate the performance when combining the networks.\n","  - **test set (15%):** This one is used at the end only once to test the generalization performance of your model once you are happy with the performance on the *val2 set*.\n","\n","2. Build and train a first neural network using the *train set*. Use the *val1 set* to estimate its performance and fine tune its parameters.\n","\n","3. Build and train a second neural network using the *train set*. Use the *val1 set* to estimate its performance while fine tuning its parameters. This network needs to have a different architecture from the previous one.\n","\n","4. Once you are happy with both networks, it is now time to combine them. Generate predictions on the *val2 set* with your two networks. The predictions should be the probabilities for each class (not the final class). Combine the probabilities of each network by multiplying them. Obtain the final predicted classes by selecting the class with the highest probability.\n","\n","5. Evaluate the performance of the combined models and of each of the individual models on the same *val2 set*. The performance of the combined models should be better than the performance of the best individual model. If this is not the case, iterate from step 2.\n","\n","6. Once you are happy with your results, evaluate the performance of the combined models and each individual one on the *test set* just once.\n","\n","### Tips:\n","\n","- You can pass your validation data to the `fit` function with the `validation_data` argument, e.g., `model.fit(..., validation_data = (val1_features, val1_labels))`.\n","- You can plot accuracy and loss curves to analyze your models behavior. See *demo_sports* notebook for an example.\n","\n","*NOTE:* In this case it was suggested to train both models with the same train data. With *Bagging* [1], which is an ensemble learning method, instead of using the same train data, new train sets are generated with bootstrapping. To construct a dataset, the method samples $N$ data points from the original train set where $N$ is the number of elements on the original train set. The sampling is made *with replacement*. Thus, the new set will contain duplicates and some elements of the original data set will not be present. The purpose of this is to have different models. If the same data is used to train them, they will be very similar and there is no need to train several of them. It is left as an exercise for the reader to implement bootstraping instead of using the same train set.\n","\n","[1] Breiman, L. (1996). Bagging predictors.
